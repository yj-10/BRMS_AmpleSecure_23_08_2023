                    thorough investigation into the background and history of an
                    individual or organization to verify the accuracy of the
                    information provided in their insurance policy application.
                    The process typically involves two stages: pre-policy
                    verification and post-policy verification. Pre-policy
                    verification is conducted before an insurance policy is
                    issued. During this stage, Bhupati Risk Mitigation Services
                    Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) will work closely with the insurance
                    company to verify the identity, background, and claims
                    history of the policy applicant. Post-policy verification is
                    conducted after a policy has been issued. During this stage,
                    Bhupati Risk Mitigation Services Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) will
                    conduct ongoing monitoring and verification of the
                    policyholder&#39;s information to ensure that it remains
                    accurate and up-to-date.
