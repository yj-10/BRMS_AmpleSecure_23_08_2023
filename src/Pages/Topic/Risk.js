                  <p>
                    Profile verification is a critical service that Bhupati Risk
                    Mitigation Services Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) provides to its
                    insurance industry clients. It involves conducting a
                    thorough investigation into the background and history of an
                    individual or organization to verify the accuracy of the
                    information provided in their insurance policy application.
                    The process typically involves two stages: pre-policy
                    verification and post-policy verification. Pre-policy
                    verification is conducted before an insurance policy is
                    issued. During this stage, Bhupati Risk Mitigation Services
                    Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) will work closely with the insurance
                    company to verify the identity, background, and claims
                    history of the policy applicant. Post-policy verification is
                    conducted after a policy has been issued. During this stage,
                    Bhupati Risk Mitigation Services Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) will
                    conduct ongoing monitoring and verification of the
                    policyholder&#39;s information to ensure that it remains
                    accurate and up-to-date.

                  <p>
                    In the field of verification and management, not every
                    detail can be verified physically through the second party.
                    At times a discreet check is required. To fulfill this
                    service Ample secure sends their executives to the
                    neighborhood of policy holders in order to cross examine
                    and check the details. Our executives have the job to
                    secretly go around their place, and indirectly investigate
                    details about them. These discreet investigations are needed
                    to make certain details be unsurfaced. Our executives
                    question certain households from the neighborhood, acting
                    as a complete stranger, about the recent activities of the
                    policy applicant or his/her family. These cross checking
                    processes and the responses obtained from them become
                    important to validate the integrity or claims of the policy
                    applicant.

                  <p>
                    In the insurance sector, a whole bunch of documents are
                    required, from a birth certificate to official papers, to
                    apply for a particular policy. And hence, with the
                    requirement of such number of documents, comes the need to
                    verify the authenticity and validity of those documents.
                    There have been cases when applicants fake their ID &amp;
                    Address Proofs, Financial docs or employment details, etc
                    while applying for policies. Document forgery is a common
                    case nowadays. This is where Bhupati Risk Mitigation
                    Services Pvt. Ltd. (BRMS) comes in the picture. Our role to
                    cross verify all the documents submitted by an applicant in
                    the insurance company. This is usually done by contacting
                    the issuing authority of those documents like hospitals,
                    government offices, etc. After examining and analyzing these
                    documents, their sources and their truthfulness, our team
                    sends a full-fledged report with valid conclusions to
                    insurance companies.

                  <p>
                    An advisor in an insurance company, or any company in
                    general, has an important task of helping the board members
                    and the head with precious pieces of advice that are
                    beneficial for the firm. An advisor is an important human
                    resource for an insurance company, as he directly generates
                    the business for it. Since, an advisor has a firm hold and
                    directly or indirectly influences the actions of a company,
                    he/she being truthful and completely trustworthy is
                    necessary. And if there are any integrity issues with the
                    advisor, it will directly affect the business. It will also
                    lead to the harm in reputation as well as monetary loss to
                    the company. Hence, Bhupati Risk Mitigation Services Pvt.
                    Ltd. (BRMS), unlike any verification, comes in role to
                    verify and check the personal details (phone number,
                    address, etc) provided by the advisor. We also examine
                    whether there is any past record of fraudulent activities or
                    not. In addition to this, we also have a role to check
                    whether the details shared by the advisor with the insurance
                    firm is authentic or not. This secures from any internal
                    threat or malice by advisors or employees working in the
                    firm.

                    When an insurance claim is made, it is important for the
                    insurance company to verify the validity of the claim and
                    ensure that the claim is not fraudulent. This is where the
                    Claim Investigation service comes into play. The
                    investigation may involve gathering evidence, conducting
                    interviews, and reviewing documentation related to the
                    claim. The investigator will also verify the details of the
                    claim, such as the cause of the loss, the extent of the
                    damage, and the value of the loss.
